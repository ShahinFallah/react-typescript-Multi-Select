## Project Description

This project was inspired by a video tutorial on YouTube ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAJlYgeovlg)). I have made some minor modifications to create this version. My primary goal is to learn better and more efficient methods for future projects. These projects serve as exercises for me to improve my skills and techniques. I take inspiration from developers who write optimized code.
